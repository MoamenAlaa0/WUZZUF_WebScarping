# :pick: WUZZUF Web Scraping 
Scraping [Wuzzuf](https://wuzzuf.net/jobs/egypt) website by applying two different web scraper versions. The first version was my first time doing web scraping, and after two weeks with hard working by reading in web scraping and applying some small projects like [YouTube comments](https://github.com/MoamenAlaa0/YouTube_Comments_WebScraping) and [Amazon reviews](https://github.com/MoamenAlaa0/Amazon_WebScraping) scraping, 
I have returned to implement the second version.

### Version :one: using: [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html)

```python
requests.get(base_url, headers = headers, timeout = 5)
```

### Version :two: using: [Requests-HTML](https://requests.readthedocs.io/projects/requests-html/en/latest/)
