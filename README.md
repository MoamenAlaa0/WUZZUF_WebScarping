# :pick: WUZZUF Web Scraping 
Scraping [Wuzzuf](https://wuzzuf.net/jobs/egypt) website by applying two different web scraper versions, In each version I have used different libraries
1. [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html)
2. Seconde version I have used [Requests-HTML](https://requests.readthedocs.io/projects/requests-html/en/latest/)
