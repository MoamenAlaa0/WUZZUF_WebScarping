# :pick: WUZZUF Web Scraping ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=MoamenAlaa0&color=green) ![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.com/{MoamenAlaa0}/{Wuzzuf_Web_Scraping})

Hi there :wave:, this project about scraping [Wuzzuf](https://wuzzuf.net/jobs/egypt) website by applying two different web scraper versions. The first version was my first time doing web scraping, and after two weeks with hard working by reading in web scraping and applying some small projects like [YouTube Comments](https://github.com/MoamenAlaa0/YouTube_Comments_WebScraping), [Amazon Reviews](https://github.com/MoamenAlaa0/Amazon_WebScraping) and [SEC Filings Tables](https://github.com/MoamenAlaa0/SEC-Web_Scraping) scraping, 
I have returned to implement the second version.

- Version :one: using: BeautifulSoup and Selenium 
- Version :two: using: Requests-HTML 

| Library/Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) | Pull the data out of HTML and XML files |
| [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html) | Automation testing tool used to scrape dynamic javascript websites |

| [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/) | Provides the capabilities of sending an HTTP request to a server |
| [urljoin](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html) | Parse module to join a base URL with another URLs |

| [pandas.DataFrame.to_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html) | Write object to a comma-separated values (csv) file |

Honestly, second version is preferred to me :grin:
